Server
-----

TCP server for chat management. It is possible to send private messages to users, create your own rooms, enter and exit rooms and send private messages between users.

![system](https://github.com/crisalexITA/mc_server_app/blob/main/assets/system.png?raw=true)

The server is made of four modules that interface with each other:
* **TCP listener (mc_server_app.erl):** manages incoming client connections and creates the processes (spawn) that will take care of them
* **input handler (input_handler.erl):** parses inputs and executes commands
* **data manager (data_manager.erl):** interacts with the database for data management (insertions, changes, deletions)
* **output hanndler (output_handler.erl):** takes care of sending messages to clients
